1.****
 - Update the screens to listen for light changes and change the light state from on to off. For example update a
 group for living room and smaller groups within should notice they are now on


- Updated to EffectsFragmentV2
    - Moved the code behind playing effects into the Effect.java class
    - This matches how Triggers was done
    - Allows for Effects to be more reusable going forward rather than trapped in the EffectsFragment
- Updated to new ColorPicker classes
    - Now uses a List/Detail Flow to show colors to be picked
- AllGroupsFragmentV2 , AllLightsFragmentV2
    - This will now use the new method to pick colors

1.2.1 (Published 3/25)

Major Updates
Look up static content (Images and Raw sound file by name, not R.id Int value). This fixes issues where wrong int value could get populated
    - updated database to version 2 (Done to implement the Database image string lookup and also make the "Pick Color" image be shown on first use for effects)
    - Changed effects database to store string for image rather than the R.id number as this can change with updates - String resorce should stay the same
    - Changed Colors to load from String rather than storing mipmap R value in database. Now looks up string name for the mipmap. This was done with the future and possible changes in mind.
    Also is hopefully fixing bug where wrong images would be shown -- (return getResources().getIdentifier(imageId, "mipmap", getContext().getPackageName());)


Minor Updates
- Changed image for unknown color to say "Pick Color" for the effects only
- Attempt to fix Defect on AllGroupsFragment Where getActivity() call was returning null (User Reported Defect)
- Updated random lights to allow for update of only one light if wanted
- Added progessBar to Memory (Beta) to show progress when correct light is guessed
- Prevented Keyboard from showing up on screen loads (User must actively click in the EditText to load keyboard)


Files Removed -- These were not used and not needed anymore as Hue had bettter ways to do them
HueHelper.java
LightGroupFactory.java

Effects Added
- Aurora effect (Per user Suggestion)
- Paint Splatter (I just like it a lot)
- Added Sound effect for Rainforest
